# MoneyApp API

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About
Versatile GraphQL API built on top of [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework for ease of use on data-analytics frontends

## üìç Purpose
1. Acting an the API for a finance management app (personal use)
2. Provide a flexible way for the front-end to interact with data
3. Learn about NestJS & GraphQL without copying from boring tutorials

## üìö Frontend repo: [HERE](https://github.com/Mingyang-Li/moneyapp-client)

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è Product roadmap
| No. | Description | Status |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1. | Query any income data by any field | ‚úÖ |
| 2. | Set limit on query amount on income | ‚úÖ |
| 3. | Query any expenses data by any field | ‚úÖ |
| 4. | Set limit on query amount on expenses | ‚úÖ |
| 5. | Group income by any field and calculate sum & counts with date-range filter | ‚úÖ |
| 6. | Group income by date with date-range filter so that the data returned also includes dates with $0 income for data-visualisation | ‚úÖ |
| 7. | Group expenses by any field and calculate sum & counts with date-range filter | ‚úÖ |
| 8. | Group expenses by date with date-range filter so that the data returned also includes dates with $0 expenses for data-visualisation | ‚úÖ |
| 9. | Query average daily income with date-range filter | ‚úÖ |
| 10. | Query average daily expenses with date-range filter | ‚úÖ |
| 11. | Query total income with date-range filter | ‚úÖ |
| 12. | Query total expenses with date-range filter | ‚úÖ |
| 13. | Query net income with date-range filter | ‚úÖ |
| 14. | Prevent authenticated BUT unauthorised users from accessing ALL endpoints | ‚úÖ |
| 14. | Automatically add new users into a `User` table in DB after they signed up the app using Auth0 | |
| 15. | Link up `Income` and `Expense` tables with `User` by introducing association rules |
| 16. | Mutation for creating row for `Income`
| 17. | Mutation for updating row for `Income`
| 18. | Mutation for creating row for `Expense`
| 19. | Mutation for updating row for `Expense`
| 20. | Subscription with pagination for retrieving rows from `Income`
| 21. | Subscription with pagination for retrieving rows from `Expense`

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Challenges & workarounds
| No. | Problem | Solution |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Rate limit from Notion API + Ugly & Inconsistent response structure from Notion SDK | Migrate table to real DB (PostgreSQL) |
| 2 | DB data isn't in sync with data from Notion | Need Notion webhook to setup triggers but none available, current plan is to manually update DB from time to time |
| 3 | There are no out-of-box auth solutions for Nest + GraphQL + Auth0 in RBAC (Role-based access-control) | Implemented a [custom guard](https://github.com/Mingyang-Li/moneyapp-api/blob/main/src/auth/gql-auth0.guard.ts) that transforms request context from REST into GraphQL context then authenticate and authorise access based on the `permissions` field of the decoded jwt token payload. |
| 4 | When returning `sum` from `IncomeGroupBy` queries, the `sum` amount does not reflect the differences in `currency` (NZD and USD) | Need to either setup compulsory currency filter in query layer or auto-calculate all USD amount to NZD by real-time exchange rate on return |
| 5 | Need to show dates with $0 income for aggregated income queries by dynamic date-range filter for time-series chart display | Used dates API to populate empty dates |

### Query income by payment method and calculate sum of income by payment method
```graphql
# Note: endDate and dateStartInc are optional.
# When date filters are not provided, the query will return all records`
query {
  incomeGroupBy (

    endDate: "Sun Nov 21 2021 12:12:28 GMT+1300 (New Zealand Daylight Time)"
